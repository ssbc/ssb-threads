# ssb-threads

> A Scuttlebot plugin for fetching messages as threads

## Usage

This plugin **requires ssb-db2 v3.4.0 or higher** and does not support ssb-db. If the **ssb-friends** plugin is available it will filter the messages of blocked users and provide the option of only retrieving information about threads created by users you follow directly.

```diff
 SecretStack({appKey: require('ssb-caps').shs})
   .use(require('ssb-master'))
   .use(require('ssb-db2'))
   .use(require('ssb-conn'))
   .use(require('ssb-friends'))
+  .use(require('ssb-threads'))
   .use(require('ssb-blobs'))
   .call(null, config)
```

```js
pull(
  ssb.threads.public({
    reverse: true, // threads sorted from most recent to least recent
    threadMaxSize: 3, // at most 3 messages in each thread
  }),
  pull.drain(thread => {
    console.log(thread);
  }),
);
```

## API

### "Thread objects"

Whenever an API returns a so-called "thread object", it refers to an object of shape `{ messages, full }` where `messages` is an array of SSB messages, and `full` is a boolean indicating whether `messages` array contains all of the possible messages in the thread. Any message that has its `root` field or `branch` field or `fork` field pointing to the root of the thread can be included in this array, but sometimes we may omit a message if the `threadMaxSize` has been reached, in which case the `messages.length` will be equal to the `threadMaxSize` option.

In TypeScript:

```typescript
type Thread = {
  messages: Array<Msg>;
  full: boolean;
}
```

### "Summary objects"

Whenever an API returns a so-called "thread summary object", it refers to an object of shape `{ root, replyCount }` where `root` is an SSB message for the top-most post in the thread, and `replyCount` is a number indicating how many other messages (besides the root) are in the thread. In TypeScript:

```typescript
type ThreadSummary = {
  root: Msg;
  replyCount: number;
}
```

### `ssb.threads.public(opts)`

Returns a pull stream that emits thread objects of public messages.

* `opts.reverse`: boolean, default `true`. `false` means threads will be delivered from oldest to most recent, `true` means they will be delivered from most recent to oldest.
* `opts.threadMaxSize`: optional number (default: Infinity). Dictates the maximum amount of messages in each returned thread object. Serves for previewing threads, particularly long ones.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.
* `opts.blocklist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to forbid as root messages, while allowing other types.
- `opts.following`: optional boolean (default: false). `true` means only threads created by those directly followed (and yourself) will be emitted. Requires `ssb-friends`.

### `ssb.threads.publicSummary(opts)`

Returns a pull stream that emits summary objects of public threads.

* `opts.reverse`: boolean, default `true`. `false` means threads will be delivered from oldest to most recent, `true` means they will be delivered from most recent to oldest.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.
* `opts.blocklist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to forbid as root messages, while allowing other types.
- `opts.following`: optional boolean (default: false). `true` means only summaries for threads created by those directly followed (and yourself) will be emitted. Requires `ssb-friends`.

### `ssb.threads.publicUpdates(opts)`

Returns a ("live") pull stream that emits a message key (strings) for every new message that passes the (optional) allowlist or blocklist.

* `opts.includeSelf`: optional boolean that indicates if updates from yourself (the current `ssb.id`) should be included in this stream or not.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.
* `opts.blocklist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to forbid as root messages, while allowing other types.
- `opts.following`: optional boolean (default: false). `true` means only message keys for threads created by those directly followed will be emitted. Requires `ssb-friends`.


### `ssb.threads.hashtagCount(opts, cb)`

Gets the number of public threads that match a specific hashtag `opts.hashtag`. "Hashtag" here means `msg.value.content.channel` and `msg.value.content.mentions[].link` (beginning with `#`).

* `opts.hashtag`: string, required. This is a short hashtag string such as `#animals` that identifies which content categary we are interested in.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.
* `opts.blocklist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to forbid as root messages, while allowing other types.


### `ssb.threads.hashtagSummary(opts)`

Similar to `publicSummary` but limits the results to public threads that match a specific hashtag `opts.hashtag`. "Hashtag" here means `msg.value.content.channel` and `msg.value.content.mentions[].link` (beginning with `#`).

* `opts.hashtag`: string, required unless you have `opts.hashtags`. This is a short hashtag string such as `#animals` that identifies which content category we are interested in.
* `opts.hashtags`: array of strings, optional. Like `opts.hashtag` but allows you to specify multiple hashtags such that summaries returned will match *any* of the hashtags.
* `opts.reverse`: boolean, default `true`. `false` means threads will be delivered from oldest to most recent, `true` means they will be delivered from most recent to oldest.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.
* `opts.blocklist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to forbid as root messages, while allowing other types.

### `ssb.threads.hashtagUpdates(opts)`

Returns a ("live") pull stream that emits the message key (string) for thread roots every time there is a new reply or root tagged with the given `opts.hashtag`, and that passes the (optional) allowlist or blocklist.

* `opts.hashtag`: string, required unless you have `opts.hashtags`. This is a short hashtag string such as `#animals` that identifies which content category we are interested in.
* `opts.hashtags`: array of strings, optional. Like `opts.hashtag` but allows you to specify multiple hashtags such that summaries returned will match *any* of the hashtags.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.

### `ssb.threads.privateUpdates(opts)`

Returns a ("live") pull stream that emits the message key (string) for thread roots every time there is a new reply or root, and that passes the (optional) allowlist or blocklist.

* `opts.includeSelf`: optional boolean that indicates if updates from yourself (the current `ssb.id`) should be included in this stream or not.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.

### `ssb.threads.profile(opts)`

Returns a pull stream that emits thread objects of public messages in which a certain profile `id`
participated in.

* `opts.id`: FeedId of some SSB user.
* `opts.reverse`: boolean., default `true`. `false` means threads will be delivered from oldest to most recent, `true` means they will be delivered from most recent to oldest.

* `opts.private`: optional boolean indicating that (when `true`) you want to get only private messages, or (when `false`) only public messages; **⚠️ Warning: you should only use this locally, do not allow remote peers to call `ssb.threads.thread`, you don't want them to see your encrypted messages.**
* `opts.threadMaxSize`: optional number (default: Infinity). Dictates the maximum amount of messages in each returned thread object. Serves for previewing threads, particularly long ones.
* `opts.allowlist`: optional array of strings. Dictates which messages **types** to allow as root messages, while forbidding other types.
